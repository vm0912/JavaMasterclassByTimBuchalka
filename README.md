Solved challenges of the Udemy course "Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers"

This repository wasn't meant to be public at first, due to the fact it was made for strengthening my Java programming skills, 
but since it shows a part of my acquired knowledge, I believe it wouldn't do any harm.
Also, as the main motivation of passing through this course was for educational purposes,
there wasn't much focus put on writing the documentation.

The course itself was chosen because it is the most reviewed and bestselling course on the Udemy platform.

All relevant information about the course is listed at the offical site (link provided at the description).
